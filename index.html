        <p class="ty">Big Ben
          Better known as Big Ben (it's actually the name of the Great Bell!), this iconic clock tower which stands at the Houses of Parliament is officially called the Elizabeth Tower, named in honor of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee. When the Elizabeth Tower is open for tours, you can climb up the tower and admire the clock and bell up close. But fret not, you can still learn about its history and admire its ornate golden facade on a tour of London or the Houses of Parliament.

    Jurassic Coast, Dorset and Devon
    This Unesco-recognised stretch of southern coastline starts at the eastern end, at the quirky resort of Swanage in Dorset, where the pillars of Old Harry Rocks overlook Poole Harbour. From here it reaches westwards, rounding wild St Aldhelms Head, stomping through fossil-rich Kimmeridge, to the almost perfect circle that is Lulworth Cove and the arch of Durdle Door. Then, from Weymouth, the Chesil shingle scythes westwards towards the cliffs of Charmouth and West Bay, so famous for their crumbliness and their fossil dinosaurs. The Regency resort of Lyme Regis, beyond, is where The French Lieutenants Woman was filmed.

    <p class="ty">Yorkshire pudding
      Pudding, for you non-Brits, is what we in the UK call dessert. But the Yorkshire pudding is a liar.

It looks all puffy and mouthwatering like a pudding, right? But dont let its friendly appearance fool you. It is not a pudding at all. Like 95% of all British cuisine, it is comprised entirely of eggs, flour, milk and fat.

Before Prozac arrived, this was often the best available alternative
    </p>

      <p class="ty">Fish fingers, chips and beans
        By which we mean, fish sticks, oven-cooked french fries and canned beans in tomato sauce.

By the age of 16, the average British child will have eaten this dish 4,160 times.

Gone to a friends house for dinner? Fish fingers, chips and beans. Got a friend round for dinner? Fish fingers, chips and beans. Mom and dad had a few drinks again? Fish fingers, chips and beans.

Proust had his madeleines. The Brits have oven chips and frozen sticks of reconstituted haddock.

<p class="tyty2">Trifle
  Cant decide on dessert? Let trifle solve the conundrum. Layer one pudding on top of another pudding on top of another and cover it all with whipped cream.

For good measure, douse the whole thing in fortified wine then chuck on a bunch of brightly colored sprinkles and a cherry.

Brits will put a cherry on top of anything and call it dessert.

<p class="tyty">Eton mess
  The heroin of desserts. In some upper-class areas of Britain, you cant move for the aristocrats passed out in the gutter having overdosed on this intoxicating mixture of meringue, cream and fruit.
